A doubly linked list functions as a versatile tool, enabling navigation both forward and backward within an array. This proves invaluable for scenarios where movement isn't confined to a single direction, as seen in streaming platforms. For instance, users can easily transition to the next episode, revisit the previous one, or skip forward and backward in small increments using dedicated buttons.

In contrast, a singly linked list operates akin to a one-way road, restricting traversal to a single direction. This characteristic becomes advantageous in specific contexts, like online tests, where a sequential progression through questions is preferred. With a singly linked list, once a question is answered, there's no option to backtrack, mirroring the linear flow of a test.

Consider the analogy of the original Super Mario game, which mirrors a singly linked list structure. Mario could only progress forward through the levels, lacking the ability to move backward. This simplistic movement aligns with the unidirectional nature of singly linked lists, illustrating how different scenarios call for distinct data structures to optimize functionality based on specific requirements.
